# ðŸŽ¯ QA Onboarding Wizard - Complete Setup Guide

## âœ¨ New Feature: Intelligent Project Setup Wizard

I've created a comprehensive onboarding wizard that guides QAs through setting up the extension for their specific project needs!

## ðŸš€ What the Onboarding Wizard Does

### **Automatic First-Time Setup:**
- **Triggers automatically** when extension is first installed
- **Guides QAs** through project configuration
- **Collects essential details** for optimal extension usage
- **Saves configuration** for future use

### **Smart Configuration Collection:**
1. **Project Details** - Name and basic info
2. **Existing Tests** - Whether they have automation
3. **App Type** - Web, Mobile, Desktop, or API
4. **Environment URLs** - Multiple environments support
5. **Login Credentials** - For apps with authentication
6. **Test Framework** - Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, etc.
7. **Capture Frequency** - Manual, daily, weekly, or on-deploy
8. **Team Size** - For collaboration features
